# DdosAttackClassifier
Machine Learning Classifer For Ddos attacks According to given DataSets.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__Code Explenations:__
__1stPart:__
Train the Models on given data set with special Parameters used for Detecting Ddos Traffic

__2ndPart:__
Load the trained weight i got for the training models into the Notebook Storage.

__3rdPart__
Load any diffrent Csv file and test the same methology on it and see the results.

__Machine Learning Methods Used:__
__Random Forest:__
Why use it? Random Forest is like a group decision-making process where each decision (tree) contributes to the final verdict (prediction).
What's good about it? It's good at handling a lot of information and finding patterns, even if they're not straightforward.
Why might it be useful for DDoS detection? DDoS attacks can have complex patterns, and Random Forest is good at spotting those patterns even if they're not simple.

__Logistic Regression:__
Why use it? It's like looking at historical data to make predictions based on similarities.
What's good about it? It's easy to understand and works well when there are only two outcomes (like "attack" or "no attack").
Why might it be useful for DDoS detection? It's good at quickly figuring out if something looks like a DDoS attack or not based on past patterns.

__Support Vector Machine (SVM):__
Why use it? It's like drawing lines to separate different types of data.
What's good about it? It's good at finding the best lines to separate different types of data, even if they're mixed up.
Why might it be useful for DDoS detection? DDoS attacks can be tricky to spot because they often look like normal traffic. SVM can help draw clear lines between normal and suspicious traffic.
